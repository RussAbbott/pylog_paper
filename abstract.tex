Pylog inhabits three programming contexts. 
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
      \item Pylog explores the integration of two distinct programming language paradigms: (i) the modern, general purpose programming paradigm, which includes procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, and (ii) logic programming, including logic variables (and unification) and depth-first, search. Pylog illustrates how logic programming features can be implemented in and integrated into Python. 
      \item Pylog demonstrates the breadth and broad applicability of Python. Python is both the most widely used language for teaching introductory programming, and it has become widely used for sophisticated programming challenges. 
      \item Pylog exemplifies programming at its best, using Python features in innovative yet clear ways. The overall result is software worth studying.

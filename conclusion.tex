\section{Conclusion}
  Pylog offers a way to integrate logic programming features into a Python environment.
  
  \begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
  \item The magic of unification of logic variables requires little more than linked chains.
  \item Prolog control structures can be implemented as nested \textbftt{for} loops, with \textbftt{yield} and \textbftt{yield} \textbftt{from} gluing the predicates together.
\end{itemize}
